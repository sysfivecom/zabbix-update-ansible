# zabbix-update-ansible
This repository contains ansible plays and roles to upgrade a complete HA Zabbix Stack in place without downtime

It contains a Vagrantfile to show the system architecture, but it does not contain the complete chef stack
that was used to create these VMs.

A talk about this is available on Youtube (from Zabbix Summit 2018):

The slides are included in this repository.
